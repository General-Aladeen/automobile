# automobile
This repository should slowly become a bank of information about automobiles. 

The idea of this repository is to build a community that constantly learns/researches together and turns this repository from one that's empty to one that has a ton of in-depth information concerning the topic. 

As I am new to the topic, I would start learning from the very basics, upload what I've learned to the fullest, and (whenever needed) research interesting topics to understand them better. As I am starting from level zero this repository would help future learners, learn from the very basic and build their knowledge from there. All in all making this repository a free hub for all those looking for information on the said topic.

This Repository focuses on automobiles (mainly cars) and would take a very non-textbook approach, as it would include information that is very university research/practical based. This repository is not for those looking to gain marks but is for those who have a genuine keen interest in automobiles/cars.

Maybe in the future, we can have a growing community, which constantly learns/researches/uploads information on automobiles.

Take a look at the branches and if you are a beginner (like me) start from the very top (001) and work your way up the ladder. As this repository is new, there will probably be just (001), so in case you are interested, join me in this new community learning experience. Let's learn from each other, upload our notes/research/resources, and work towards a singular goal of gaining knowledge, conducting research, and becoming automobile/car experts.
