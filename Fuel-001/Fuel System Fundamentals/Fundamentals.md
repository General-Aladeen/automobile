# Fuel Systems Fundamentals

*General-Aladeen 10th May 2021*

2 Main types of Fuel Systems
- Carburator Fuel System
- Fuel Injection System 

The main purpose of a fuel system is to store liquid gasoline (or any other fuel) and deliver it to the cylinders of an engine, normally in the form of liquid mixed with air. The amount of fuel delivered also varies, as different amounts of fuel are required at different operating conditions of the engine. 
- Rich Fuel air ratio is required during the cold start of the engine *around 9:1 gasoline air ratio*
- Once the engine is warm the gasoline air ratio has to be leaned out *around 15:1 air gasoline ratio*
- When the car is accelerated the gasoline air ratio must be made rich again

The Fuel System usually has these main components:
- Fuel tank – it is a fuel storage reservoir. The fuel tank of modern cars is a difficult system, which includes next elements: reservoir, fuel neck, fuel gauge, fuel pump, and others;
- Fuel Pipeline system – these are pipelines that provide fuel supply to other fuel elements;
- Fuel pump – is a device that pumps the fuel from the tank to the engine; Fuel pump of modern injection systems creates enough high pressure. Electrical fuel pumps are common use in modern cars. Diesel engine pumps can be two types: low and high pressure. Typically high-pressure pumps are used on the diesel engine.
- Fuel filter (or filters). There are two types of fuel filters, coarse fuel filter, and fine fuel filter; The purpose of filters is cleaning of fuel from different types of dirty, dusty, and so on.
- Fuel injection device or Carburetor. It is a device in which supplies fuel and air to create an air-fuel mixture. 

As I was learning just the fundamentals, I did not go into the chemistry of the fuel instead I stuck to the simple operations. Fuel chemistry would probably be covered once I do Fuel 002. 

The rest of my learning session would pertain to each of the operations. This folder also should have diagrams, details, and citations.
